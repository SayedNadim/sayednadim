### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am currently working as a team lead and AI researcher in [DeltaX.ai](http://deltax.ai/renewal/eng/). Prior to that, I was working as a vision researcher in [CVIP Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/gachoncvip/home), Gachon University, Republic of Korea. 

I have completed my master's from the Department of Software (2019-2021) from Gachon University. My undergrad was from University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (2013-2017).
