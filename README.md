### Hi there
---
I am Sayed Nadim.

I am originally from Bangladesh üáßüá© and currently working as a researcher in South Korea. Thank you for visiting my profile! Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or just have a chat. üòä

##  What Do I Do
-  I am a computer vision researcher with experience in developing cutting-edge AI-based solutions and a passionate developer who loves to explore new technologies and build innovative projects.
-  I have 6+ years of experience in designing traditional/deep learning methods for 2D \& 3D image processing techniques, utilizing supervised/semi-supervised/unsupervised learning, working with different sensors (RGB pinhole/wideangle/Fisheye cameras, Monochrome cameras, NIR/LWIR cameras, Neuromorphic sensors, LiDAR, IMU, etc.), and deep generative vision models.


##  What I'm Working On
-  I‚Äôm currently working on in-cabin algorithms and monocular depth estimation.
-  I'm also trying to find a way to have a better convolution mechanism (this is above my current knowledge but I am digging deeper)
-  I usually work with PyTorch with some C++.  

##  Looking to Collaborate On
- Open source projects that make a difference.
- Innovative ideas that can solve real-world problems.
