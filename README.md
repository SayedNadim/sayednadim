### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
---

I am a computer vision researcher with experience in developing cutting-edge AI-based solutions for autonomous vehicles, leading a mid-size team (12+ developers) and concurrently working as an AI researcher. I have experience in designing traditional/deep learning methods for 2D \& 3D image processing techniques, utilizing supervised/semi-supervised/unsupervised learning, working with different sensors (RGB pinhole/wideangle/Fisheye cameras, Monochrome cameras, NIR/LWIR cameras, Neuromorphic sensors, LiDAR, IMU, etc.), and deep generative models. 

I am currently working as a team lead and AI researcher in [DeltaX.ai](http://deltax.ai/renewal/eng/). Prior to that, I was working as a vision researcher in [CVIP Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/gachoncvip/home), Gachon University, Republic of Korea.
